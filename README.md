# simple-js-app

This project produces a simple app that displays an interactive list of
pokemon. Users can click on the pokemon name to view a modal that contains
details and an image of each pokemon.

This project utilizes the PokeApi (https://pokeapi.co/) for pokemon content,
Bootstrap for app layout and formatting, and CSS for additional styling.
